# Collaborative Deep Reinforcement Learning

Collaborative Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) is collaborative framework to enable knowledge transfer among heterogeneous tasks.

## How to run:
|>heterogeneousTransfer
```python train.py --num-MTL-workers 8 0 --env-id PongDeterministic-v3_Bowling-v0```

|>CDRL
```python train.py --num-MTL-workers 8 8 --env-id PongDeterministic-v3_Bowling-v0```
